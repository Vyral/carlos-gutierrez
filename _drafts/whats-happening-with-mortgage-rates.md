While there are plenty of headlines screaming about how low mortgages are right now, it's important to remember that not all mortgages are the same.

Mortgage rates are low, but **credit availability is still incredibly tight due to the government’s mortgage bailout**. It allows borrowers with government-backed loans to delay up to a year’s worth of payments if they have financial strain due to the coronavirus. More than 3 million borrowers are already in that program, and the risk to lenders is only increasing, which has in turn made their underwriting far more strict.
