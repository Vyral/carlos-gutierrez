<br>Today’s question is: How long does it take to sell a home in San Diego?

That’s a tough one. While I can give you the current statistics and figures on overall market times and how fast homes sell in specific ZIP codes and areas, that doesn’t tell the whole story. It’s all about the questions you ask when it comes to how much time a home will spend on the market. **Some questions to ask would be: Was the home properly priced, prepared, marketed, and staged?**

Homes that have done all of this correctly will sell quickly. When homes don’t sell quickly, the market is telling you it’s overpriced. That’s why who you choose to sell your home really does matter.

Any questions you have, if you’re considering taking advantage of the market, selling, need financing, please call or email me. I would be glad to help you.
