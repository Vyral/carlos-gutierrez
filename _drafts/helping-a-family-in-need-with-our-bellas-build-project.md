Giving back to the community is something my family and I have always been passionate about.

I recently had the privilege of appearing on Good Morning San Diego with my daughter Bella to share some news about a very special project my team, my family, and I have been working on: Bella’s Build. After observing the efforts and work of Pacific Sotheby’s “Agents of Change”, we were inspired to raise money to build a home for a family in need in Tijuana, Mexico.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
