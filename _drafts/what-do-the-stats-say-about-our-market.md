<br>We’re more than a month into 2020, and our San Diego County real estate market is still very strong.

From February 2019 to this past January, pending sales rose by 5.3%, and the price range with the largest gain in sales was from $1 million to $1.5 million (a 15% bump).

During that same time, the median sales price rose 2.6% to $585,000. Any properties listed below the $500,000 mark usually only lasted a maximum of three weeks on the market, while luxury properties listed over the $5-million mark lasted 100 days on the market, on average.

**Both of these numbers indicate that buyers are looking for homes and ready to move on properties that are priced correctly**. Inventory, meanwhile, has dropped by 38%, and we only have a 1.4-month supply for single-family homes.

What does this mean for you? You’re not a statistic, and I want to help you reach your personal goals. When it comes to real estate, who you work with matters 110%, so if you’re looking for someone with an investor mindset who’ll help you get the best deal possible, give me a call.

As always, if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.
