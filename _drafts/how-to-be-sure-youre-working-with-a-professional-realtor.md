It can be hard to find a professional you can trust. When the market is really hot like it has been here in San Diego, a lot of people think that they can make some fast money by selling real estate. I know that it can be hard to tell the difference between a good and bad Realtor, so I’m going to share three questions to ask a Realtor before you decide to work with them:

**1. “How long have you been working in real estate?** How many homes do you sell each month?” Their answer to these questions will tell you if they work in the business as a professional or if it’s a hobby to them. Many think that real estate is fast, easy money, but people who think they can make a quick buck will usually not last very long in the business.

**2. “How do you determine the price of a property?”** Getting the right price when you list your home can mean the difference between selling your home quickly and leaving it to linger on the market. When you interview Realtors, the answer to this question should include more than something like checking the comparable sales; a true professional will have a strategy to price your home correctly. If you’d like to know what your home is worth, I have a free, confidential valuation toolkit.

**3. “What is your marketing plan?”** Sticking a sign in the yard, putting the listing on the MLS, and then praying that the home sells is not a good plan. There are over 30 ways a professional can market your home, so make sure your agent is maximizing their network and that they have a plan in place to help you achieve your real estate goals.
