<br>We’re all connected to our community. When you buy a home, you invest in that community, and I believe that when we invest in our community, we all win.

I love helping people write their real estate success stories, and I want to give you three tips on how to organize your own community beautification project.

**1\. Contact your city council or local representative**. Local officials are committed to improving neighborhoods. Schedule a time with them to talk about how you can get involved and use their help to not go bankrupt investing in your community.

**2\. Create a list of specific goals you hope to achieve**. It can be overwhelming if you don’t break down your project into smaller tasks. For example, you might write down something like “Clear all trash off of the west side of the main street” so you have an attainable goal.

**3\. Get out and talk to your neighbors**. Start knocking on doors and letting people know you want to beautify the neighborhood. You’ll find support in numbers. NextDoor is a great app to find people with the same idea in mind.

Everybody wins when you clean up the neighborhood. Not only is it nice to see a clean neighborhood, but it causes home values to rise too.

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you beautify your neighborhood.
