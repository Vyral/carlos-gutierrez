Buying a home can be a difficult and complex process. I recently had the pleasure of joining Carlos Amezcua on KUSI News’ “Good Morning San Diego” to talk about our current market and why it’s such a great time to buy or invest in real estate. I also discussed some of the most disastrous home buying mistakes possible. By avoiding these mistakes, you can take advantage of the strong market, where homes are selling within weeks.
