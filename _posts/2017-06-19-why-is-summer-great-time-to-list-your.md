We all think of long, lazy days when we think of summer, but did you know that summer is actually a great time to sell your home?


Summertime is here; the days are longer, the weather is warmer, and everyone seems to be more relaxed. We all think of long, lazy days when we think of summer, but did you know it’s a great time to sell your home?

San Diego is in a pretty hot market right now. Home prices are up and mortgage rates continue to remain relatively low. We are at the top of this real estate market cycle, and there’s never been a better time to sell your property.

There are three main reasons why summer is a great time to sell your home:

**1. Buyers are more relaxed.** There aren’t any major holidays and school is out, so buyers are simply less stressed.

**2. They have vacation homes on their mind.** In San Diego, that means big business. People are looking for the perfect summer home or that income property. Income properties are a pretty hot commodity right now in our market.

**3. Better weather means more traffic.** When the weather is nice, you can expect 15% more traffic coming through your home. More traffic means more buyers.

If you’re interested in getting your home on the market this summer, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
