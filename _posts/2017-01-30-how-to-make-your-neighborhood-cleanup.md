There are a ton of positive benefits to organizing a community cleanup project. Here are a few of them.

Your cleanup day is almost here! You need help, so I’ve got some great tips to share. I really enjoy helping others write their real estate success stories. As promised, I am here to give you some tips on how to organize and motivate the people in your neighborhood for your own community beautification project. Here are three things to keep in mind when planning your cleanup:

 **1. Show me the money.** You don’t have to pay people in cash, you just need to share with them how much value will be added to their home by cleaning up the neighborhood. The nicer it looks, the more home values go up.

**2. Shout it out.** Post on local neighborhood Facebook groups or even on Craigslist to increase turnout. Make a flyer, walk the neighborhood, and introduce yourself to some neighbors you haven’t met before. Let them know when and where the dumpsters will be located. You can also contact your local media to let them know and ask if they could get the word out. The world is in so much need right now of positive community stories. The local media loves those stories and are happy to share them. Start making your own positive news story today.

 **3. Be positive.** Your energy will spark others to want to take action. Maintaining a positive attitude is one of the keys to ensuring success.

 If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
