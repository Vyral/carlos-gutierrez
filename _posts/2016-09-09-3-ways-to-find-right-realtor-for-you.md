Have you ever met a bad Realtor? They can change the way you view this profession.

 When you need a real estate professional, it can be hard to find someone you can trust. When the market is hot like it's been lately, a lot of people think they can make a quick buck selling real estate, and these people can be hard to spot. To help you differentiate between a good Realtor and a bad one, I want to share the three things you should ask a Realtor before you decide to work with them.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1. How long have you been selling real estate full-time, and how many homes are you selling?** This will show you if real estate is a profession for them or just a hobby. People who think they can use real estate to make a quick buck don't last long in this market.   

**2. How do you determine the price of a property?** Listing your home at the right price can be the difference between selling or lingering on the market with no offers. Pricing a home is more than checking the compsâ€”a true professional will have a comprehensive strategy for pricing.

**3. What is your marketing plan?** Sticking a sign in the yard and listing your house on the MLS is not a marketing plan. There are more than 30 different ways a professional agent can market your home, so make sure your agent is maximizing their network and has a strategy to help you achieve your real estate goals.

 I really hope these tips help you find the right Realtor when the time comes. If you have any more questions about finding the right agent, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I hope to hear from you soon!
