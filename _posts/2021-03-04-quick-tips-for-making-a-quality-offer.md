The real estate market has been very strong both here in San Diego and across the country. This means multiple offers are coming in on many homes and, as a result, buyers need to write strong offers to stand out to these sellers.
When writing your offer, the most crucial elements are the appraisal and loan contingencies, plus the time frame for inspections.  
Once you’ve read the disclosures and had your physical & termite inspections, then it’s time for the lender to approve the removal of the loan contingency 17 to 21 days into the process. In this hot market, you want to reduce contingencies to make your offer the strongest it can be. Make sure to read through all the fine print and confirm you’re satisfied with the property. 
If you ever need anything real estate-related or have questions, please call or email me. I’m here to help you win in the game of real estate.
