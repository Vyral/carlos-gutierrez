<center><em>Finding a coach is very important in this industry. Let me share why.</em></center>

<br>I recently had an interesting conversation where a gentleman from eXp called me about one of my listings down the street. He said, “Hey Carlos, I saw your sign was down and I thought I’d give you a call and let you know that you might want to call the company to come put it back out.” I’d never met this person and didn’t know his name, but I thanked him.

He then continued, “I also wanted to pick your brain. I see that you’re doing such an amazing job here in the beach area and around San Diego—what are you doing?”

I told him that I get up every day being thankful for what I have. I work out, I kiss my wife and daughter, and then I do whatever I need to mentally and physically feel good. After that, I get dressed for the day and start calling people to talk to them, offer them services, and ask them how I can help them today. Then I asked him, “What do *you* do?” He had to think about it.

That’s why it’s so important for those of us in the business to get a coach. I’ve been a coach for nearly 10 years, not only spiritually, physically, and mentally, but also here in my business.

**Getting a coach will also help your clients**. Think about it: pro-athletes are talented, but it takes the skilled eye and guidance from a coach to take them to a victory. With someone helping you to improve, you’re better able to help others.

That reminds me that I was recently listening to a great book while on a road trip, “Think and Grow Rich” by Napoleon Hill. In it, the author said that whatever a man can conceive, he can achieve. However, you have to consider what it is that you actually want, and you need to write it down. Mind, you have to be specific, too—instead of writing down that you want a bunch of money, come up with a concrete number and consider what you’re willing to do for it. How much time and energy are you willing to commit to making that goal a reality? **Things don’t just happen because you want them to**.

If I can ever help you improve your business and help you reach your goals, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
