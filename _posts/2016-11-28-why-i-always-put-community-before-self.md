I love helping people write their own real estate success stories and I’m passionate about giving back to the community here in San Diego. As I learned from my mentors, putting your community before yourself is key.

Recently, I helped beautify a San Diego neighborhood out in Grant Hill. Check out the video above and you’ll see a clip from NBC7 about our latest clean up effort. I got permission from the city to clean up the area, so I donated $10,000 to the project, got some volunteers together, and we got to work.

You have to be the change that you want to see in the world. Watch for my next videos that show how you can start a community clean up in your own neighborhood. Getting organized to help your community does not cost as much as you think.

Remember, if you put time and energy into helping your community, people will see that you care. If you have any questions in the meantime, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
