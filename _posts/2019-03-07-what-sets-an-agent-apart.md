There are a few things that make an agent stand out among the rest—one is their ability to spread the word about your listing.

As soon as I list a client’s home, **I begin to place calls to everyone in their neighborhood.** A new listing is great news for area residents—they can invite friends and family to become homeowners in the neighborhood they love.

I make the same call when a home goes into escrow, and another one when we’ve sold the property.

When I was making my calls recently, I spoke to a neighborhood resident who was already working with another agent. She did, however, need a referral for a great property manager. I gave her my suggestions and it worked out well.

Three weeks later, I received a call from the same person. Her agent wasn’t working out, so she asked me to step in. Two weeks later, we’d already written three offers and one of them stuck—**s****he now has a pending home sale!**

If you need help with anything related to real estate, have any questions, or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
