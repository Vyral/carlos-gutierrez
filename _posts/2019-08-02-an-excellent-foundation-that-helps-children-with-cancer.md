<center><em>Today I&rsquo;m joined by my good friend Richard Nares, founder of the Emilio Nares Foundation, to learn a bit more about their organization.</em></center>

&nbsp;

**The Emilio Nares Foundation is a non-profit organization that has been around for 16 years. Richard was inspired to start the foundation by the loss of his son, Emilio, who passed away from leukemia in 2000**. The Foundation focuses on helping families navigate their child’s journey with cancer through a variety of programs.

“Rides With Emilio” is one of their better-known programs that **provides free transportation for underprivileged children and their parents to and from the hospital for cancer-related appointments**. This service provides over 3,000 trips a year. It’s crucial that these children be able to make it to their hospital appointments, and “Rides With Emilio” help many families in need to do just that. This year, Richard intends to extend this service to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.

Last year, Richard held and participated in a sponsored run from the Seattle Children’s Hospital to San Diego—that’s a total of 1,700 miles\! Along the way, they stopped at nine children’s hospitals to hand out Emilio’s Loving Tab Healing t-shirts. These are custom-designed shirts with snaps on the shoulder and sleeve to facilitate access to chemotherapy for children with cancer. **These breathable shirts provide a sense of normalcy so children don’t have to take off or lift a shirt to receive treatment**.

Beyond these, Richard hosts several fundraisers throughout the year. Coming up on September 22, 2019, you can **join him at the 16th Annual <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.classy.org/event/16th-annual-harvest-for-hope/e221563">&ldquo;Harvest For Hope&rdquo; event</a></u> at The Brick in Liberty Station**. From 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. you can enjoy food from the best chefs, great wine, and excellent silent auction packages, the **proceeds of which go toward helping low-income, underprivileged families whose children are battling cancer**.

After implementing the “Rides With Emilio” program in L.A., Richard plans to travel along the West Coast to see about making the same implementation at other hospitals.

Ultimately, Richard has led his efforts in this foundation with thoughts of Emilio in mind. **He believes that Emilio would be very proud of the organization, and I absolutely agree**.
