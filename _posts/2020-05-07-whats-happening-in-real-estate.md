<center><em>Here's what you need to know about the national real estate market.</em></center>

<br>I have some wonderful news to share about the real estate market\!

First, in March, the national real estate market saw a slowdown as everyone was waiting to see what would happen with the health crisis. The great news is, **buyer demand is steadily climbing again**, and **we’re seeing more pending sales and signed contracts**. However, closings are still about 32% lower than usual. Buyers are buying, but nationally the inventory is still extremely low.
