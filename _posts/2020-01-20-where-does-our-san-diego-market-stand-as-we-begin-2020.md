<center><em>On my latest appearance on &ldquo;Good Morning San Diego,&rdquo; I provided the first market update for San Diego in 2020.</em></center>

<br>I was recently a guest on “Good Morning San Diego” and had the opportunity to elaborate on the current state of our San Diego real estate market, make a few predictions for 2020, and shed some light on a couple of exciting home builder initiatives. In short, **I think we’re dealing with a great market**. Now that we’re entering a new decade, we’re in uncharted territory.

Real estate moves in five-to-seven-year cycles, and we’re in year 11 of an upward trend. Interest rates are low, there is a shortage of inventory in most places around the country, baby boomers are aging, and many home builders aren’t building as many homes as they should.

**Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch it in its entirety or use these timestamps to browse specific points at your leisure:**
