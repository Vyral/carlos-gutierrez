When the market is hot and agents are fighting over listings, it’s easy to get caught up in the crossfire, which can cost you the sale of the home. One of the worst things that I see agents do all too often is overprice homes. Lucky for you, I have three easy ways to ensure this doesn’t happen to you.

**1. Use a trusted home valuation tool.** Don’t rely on sites like Zillow and Trulia. Their home values can be off by as much as 25%!

**2. Get a professional opinion.** Once you get an online valuation, call a professional to come see your home. Each home is unique, and there are many factors that can make your home worth more than your neighbors'. I love to give homeowners this information because it empowers them to make the best decisions.

**3. Keep current.** Home values in markets like San Diego can change quickly and your information can become outdated pretty quick. Don’t hesitate to subscribe to monthly emails or newsletters to stay in the loop.
