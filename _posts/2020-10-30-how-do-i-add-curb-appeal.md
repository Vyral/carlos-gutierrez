<center><em>Here&rsquo;s how to add some curb appeal to your home so buyers are wowed.</em></center>

<br>Curb appeal is crucial when selling your home. Adding curb appeal helps the house look great when prospective buyers arrive. The first impression makes a huge difference. **While curb appeal projects may not add substantial monetary value, they *will* help you sell quicker**.

Things that add curb appeal include a well-manicured lawn, low-cost landscaping, fresh paint, and new fixtures. The fantastic news is, you can do all this yourself, it’ll save you money and time, and these tasks are easy. When selling your property, you should paint with neutral colors; now’s not the time to incorporate vivid design choices —you want to appeal to as many buyers as possible.

Good lighting inside the home is also important, but don’t overdo it. You want the house to look bright and inviting, but don’t break the bank.
