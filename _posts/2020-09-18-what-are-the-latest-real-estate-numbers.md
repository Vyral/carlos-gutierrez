<center><em>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about our San Diego real estate market.</em></center>

<br>Can you believe it’s already September? Right now, the real estate market in San Diego continues to be headlined by healthy buyer demand and a low supply of inventory.

**According to the San Diego Association of Realtors, the year-over-year numbers from August are as follows:**

* Closed sales in San Diego increased 3.3% for detached homes and 4.5% for attached homes.
* Pending sales were up 21.4% in detached homes and 26% in attached homes.
* Inventory decreased 51.8% for detached homes and 28.9% for attached homes.
* The median sale price increased by 11.5% for detached homes and 7.4% for attached homes.
* Days on market are down 3.4% for detached homes and 3.7% for attached homes.
* Overall supply decreased 53.6% for detached homes and 32% for attached homes.

Although unemployment has dropped down from its peak in March and April, more than 1 million new claims are being filed each week, and more than 31 million people were claiming benefits as of early July. **Despite the significant economic impact, homebuyers seem pretty resilient**. With mortgage rates near record lows, high buyer activity is expected to continue through the rest of this year.
