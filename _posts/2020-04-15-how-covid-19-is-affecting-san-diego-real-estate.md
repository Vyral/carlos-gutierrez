<center><em>Even though we&rsquo;re in the midst of a global pandemic, people are still buying and selling homes because we have some great market conditions.</em></center>

<br>Though our daily lives have changed immeasurably during this pandemic, I hope you and your family are managing to stay safe and healthy. Today I have a quick update for you about what’s been happening in the San Diego real estate market.

Unemployment continues to go through the roof and lending is tightening up, but people continue to buy and sell homes. Closed sales have dropped by 6% for detached homes, but they’ve actually gone up for condos. Even though we’re in the midst of a pandemic and the economy is in disarray, **there are still opportunities out there for both buyers and sellers** to take advantage of.

If you need anything, please give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.
