<center><em>Here&rsquo;s what a veteran electrician has to say to homeowners in our market.</em></center>

<br>Today I’m joined by a longtime friend and skilled electrician, Aaron Ramos. In our current hot market, Aaron has been kept busy by a lot of remodels and solar panel installations. He’s helped homeowners and property management companies remain in compliance with California’s Title 24 code, which was designed to reduce wasteful energy consumption. As Aaron explained, solar panels are a great way to cut down your energy bill, even though their upfront costs can be steep. &nbsp;

Electrical is a big deal when you’re buying or remodeling a home, and you want to **have an expert make sure everything is functioning and safe.** Aaron, for example, has over 25 years of experience in the field, and he’s headed his own company for 12 years now. He’s included on our vetted vendor list, which you can access <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pdfhost.io/v/b1TNjBNDC_vendors.pdf">here</a></u>; it doesn’t take much research on your own to find out that he’s one of San Diego’s best.&nbsp;

What does he have to say to anyone thinking about remodeling or building a new home? Make sure you hire a qualified electrician, whether it’s him or somebody else. “So many times, you'll go inside a house and \[the owner has\] a carpenter that does everything,” Aaron said. “They do plumbing, they do drywall, they do tile, they do electric… you can just tell when somebody doesn’t know what they’re doing, and that’s a fire hazard.”&nbsp;

When looking for an electrician, Aaron recommends getting referrals from people you trust who can testify to a company’s quality standard. Check out the <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cslb.ca.gov/">Contractors State License Board </a>website</u>&nbsp;and search a name or company to **verify that who you’re working with is licensed and bonded in the state of California.&nbsp;**

Again, if you’re looking for a well-qualified electrician who can get the job done properly, Aaron Ramos has my full confidence and stamp of approval. Reach out to him at [aramoselectic@gmail.com](mailto:aramoselectic@gmail.com) or (619) 990-2002.&nbsp;
