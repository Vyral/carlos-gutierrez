<center><em>San Diego is an incredible place to invest in real estate, and today I&rsquo;d like to share 10 reasons why.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Recently, I had the privilege of appearing on “Good Morning San Diego” to discuss something that’s garnered a lot of buzz recently: real estate investing.

There’s no time like the present to get started in real estate investing, and San Diego is a fantastic place to do so. You can learn more about why this is the case by checking out my recent appearance on “Good Morning San Diego” above, but, for now, **here is a quick list of the top 10 reasons why:**

**1\.** Investment properties in San Diego are a bargain compared to elsewhere in the U.S.

**2\.** Home prices haven’t been this great in years.

**3\.** New houses aren’t coming onto the market very quickly.&nbsp;

**4\.** Rental rates in San Diego are amazing.&nbsp;

**5\.** Because there is no rent control, San Diego is more landlord-friendly than most cities.

**6\.** The rental population is massive in San Diego.

**7\.** Given its popularity among tourists, San Diego is a great place for short-term rentals.

**8\.** Our large military population creates a strong demand for rentals.

**9\.** The large population of students creates a strong demand for rentals.

**10\.** The supply of properties in San Diego is constantly strained, leading many would-be buyers to turn to renting, instead.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
