How much do you need for your down payment when buying a home? For first-time homebuyers, affording the down payment is usually the biggest hurdle. Unfortunately, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. **You may have to pay anywhere from 0% down to the full 20%**. Where you fall in that range depends on a lot of factors, including your credit score, employment history, bank balances, etc.

Once you know these things, you can start looking at the hundreds of loan options available to you. **The best thing you can do to answer this question for yourself is to talk to a lender**. They’ll have all the latest information about every loan option, and they’ll help you find the best deal possible.
