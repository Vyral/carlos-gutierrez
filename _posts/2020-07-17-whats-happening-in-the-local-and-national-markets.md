<center><em>Here&rsquo;s how both the local and national real estate markets are doing.</em></center>

<br>I have some wonderful news to share\! The real estate market around the country has been on the rise, according to the National Association of Realtors. They tracked 4.93 million home sales in May across the U.S. **Sales have increased by about 44%**, which is the largest month-over-month gain since January 2001.

Here in San Diego, we’re seeing similar trends, with pending home sales up 21%, though new listings have decreased by around 31%. This means there aren’t enough homes for sale to keep up with demand. So, if you’re on the fence, it’s an excellent time to take advantage of our market. Pricing is increasing in certain areas but is otherwise stable. There are advantages to being a buyer and a seller right now.

If you’re planning to sell, do a deep cleaning and summer check-up to ensure everything is running smoothly. **A few critical items to check: water heater, smoke detectors, and carbon dioxide detectors**. Many things are happening in the San Diego market right now, which is exciting.

If you have questions about preparing your home for sale or need anything real estate-related, give me a call or send an email. I have a vetted <u><a target="_blank" href="https://pdfhost.io/v/b1TNjBNDC_vendors.pdf">vendor list</a></u>, so if you need a painter, handyman, contractor, plumber, etc., these are vendors I trust and have used personally. I would love to help you in any way I can.
