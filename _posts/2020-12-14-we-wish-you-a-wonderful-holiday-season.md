<center><em>May your holiday season be filled with joy and gratitude!</em></center>

<br>From our family to yours, **we wish you a very, very happy holiday\!** We know this holiday season will be a bit different from years past given the craziness of 2020, but it’s still a perfect time to reflect on what matters most and celebrate loved ones. Bella, Jeannete, and I want to say thank you for supporting our business; we’re grateful for the trust you place in our ability to help folks have smooth transactions as they move into and out of the San Diego area.

We appreciate everything you’ve done for us in this year full of unique challenges, and we hope you and your families enjoy a marvelous finish to 2020 and have a fantastic new year\! Stay safe, and remember: Life is 5% what happens and 95% how we react. Spread the holiday cheer with an attitude of gratitude, and have yourself a merry Christmas\!&nbsp;
