Carlos Gutierrez has been serving clients in San Diego County since 2005. Here’s what just a few of those clients have to say.

As a full-time real estate agent, Carlos Gutierrez has earned the Chairman’s Circle Platinum award for his sales performance in 2013, ranking him among the top 1% of Coldwell Banker sales associates. But, the successes most important to Carlos are the ones that come not in the form of awards, but in the form of satisfied clients.


Since 2005, Carlos has been serving buyers, sellers, and investors throughout San Diego County—treating each and every transaction as if it were his very own.
 And his clients have noticed.

Diane Gaske is one such client. She’s known Carlos for 25 years—since meeting him at the elementary school she once worked at. Years later, when it came time for Diane to sell the home she had lived in for 27 years, she knew she would need the right person to help.

For her, and many others, Carlos is that person.

She recalls Carlos sending postcards to all of her neighbors and hosting multiple open houses—something she says ultimately paid off, since her house sold in less than two weeks.
 Another client, Matthew, first encountered Carlos when he helped Matthew’s father to sell the home he had been struggling to sell for months in just 15 days. The reason for Carlos’ success, according to Matthew, is that he listens to clients and creates unique, detailed plans according to their needs.

Something that stuck with Matthew, specifically, is when Carlos came to him with a 27-point presentation explaining what he was going to do to sell his house. Matthew emphasized to us that what Carlos does is different for every client—because every client is different.

Matthew says that, because of this, “He was able to do what he said he was going to do.” He also says that Carlos only “promises what he can deliver” and that “his communication is extraordinary.”

Other clients had praise for Carlos, as well. According to Jan and Mike Neil, “You are foremost and number one in his mind” while you are working with him.

All of these people are real clients who Carlos has gone above and beyond for. So, if you are thinking of working with him, remember them when making your decision. Diane, who has known him for 25 years, says she recommends Carlos “110%.”

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you, soon.
