So you want to be the change in your neighborhood, but you don’t know where to start. It’s okay—I know the feeling, and I’m here to help. In my last video, I gave you some tips on how to organize your own community beautification project. Today, I want to share with you three great tips on how to continue this community outreach:

**1. Contact your local city council member or local area representative.** These people are committed to helping improve neighborhoods. Set up a time to sit down and talk with them or just call them and parlay over the phone.

**2. Create a list of specific goals you hope to achieve.** This project can become overwhelming if you don’t break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, you might just write down “clear all trash off west side of Main Street.” Make it that specific so you have an attainable goal to share with the rest of the team.

**3. Get out there and talk to your neighbors.** Start knocking on doors and letting people know what’s happening. If you don’t know your neighbors, introduce yourself. If you really want to start beautifying a neighborhood, you want support in numbers.

Everyone wins when you clean up a neighborhood. Not only is it nice to see a clean, well-maintained area, but home values will go up, crime will go down, and it’s something everyone can get behind.

In my next video, we’ll talk about how you can get the materials to get this job done. In the meantime, if you have any questions about the community beautification process or anything real estate-related, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I'd be happy to help you!
