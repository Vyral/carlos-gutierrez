Today, I have three tips to get you the resources you need for your community beautification project.

You decided to beautify your community—congratulations! You have the drive and the goals, but you don’t have any of the resources yet. Here are three great tips to help you get started:

 **1. Reach out to local waste management companies** and ask them to donate a dumpster for the day. Many waste management companies will donate dumpsters during the weekend for all of the neighborhood’s trash.

 **2. Contact local business owners** and ask if they are willing to help sponsor the event. Maybe they can throw in some money, food, flowers, or rocks in exchange for advertising and posting on social media. Let them know that you will pass out flyers and post on social media to spotlight their company as they help the community clean up.

**3. Search Craigslist for free items** like dirt, rocks, or plants. A lot of people have things that they just want hauled away. If you have a truck, then you have access to some free resources.

 Community beautification projects help increase home values in your neighborhood and lower the crime rate. Next, we’ll talk about how to organize and motivate others.

 In the meantime, if you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
